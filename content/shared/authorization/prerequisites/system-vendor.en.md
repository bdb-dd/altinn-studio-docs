- The system vendor must create a client in Maskinporten for the system, which gets a client ID that will be used for authentication and authorization.

- For provider-controlled flow: access to scopes `altinn:authentication/systemuser.request.read` and `altinn:authentication/systemuser.request.write`
- Access to scopes for the APIs that the system will use (provided by service owner)
