If the component in the form is to be used to collect data, it must be linked to the corresponding field in the data model.
- Open the section in the configuration column called "Data Model Bindings"
- Click on the available binding (e.g., "short answer") and select the desired field in the data model from the list. The list is searchable.
- Close the setup by clicking the X icon, or remove the binding by clicking the trash can icon.
