If a conflict arises, or if changes have been made that you want to discard, you can delete all changes that have been made in _your file area_. The service will then be reset to how it is on _the service's central file area_.

1. Click on the menu button marked with 3 dots all the way to the right on the menu bar.
2. Choose "Local changes".
3. If you have any changes you want to keep, they can be downloaded here, either by downloading all files for the entire service, or by downloading only the files that have been changed.
4. To delete all changes in _your file area_, select "Delete local changes".
5. In the dialog that opens, you must enter the name of the service to confirm the deletion. Enter the name and click "Delete my changes" to delete, or "Cancel" to cancel.
