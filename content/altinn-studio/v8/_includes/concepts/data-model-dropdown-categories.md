Models appear in two categories in the dropdown list:

**XSD**
- Shows XSD files that don't have a corresponding JSON Schema yet
- Selecting one imports it and generates JSON Schema

**JSON Schema**
- Shows models that have been uploaded or created in the tool
- These are actively editable in the tool
