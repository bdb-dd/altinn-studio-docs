The data model defines the data expected to be collected and the format it should be in.
> _**One can think of a data model as a table of contents for the form.**_

For a simple form, there is often a 1-1 correspondence from fields in the data model to fields in the form, while for more advanced
forms, the data model and form may be quite different.

The data model is used to determine _what_ data should be collected. It is also used to determine _how_ the data should look/be, by
setting constraints that are validated.
